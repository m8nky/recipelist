= Recipe server in Python3

This little service is supposed to help learn coding in Python3. The idea is to serve cooking recipes to a web consumer.


== Goal

The expected result is:

* Implement a recipe service in Python3, based on the template in this repository.
* Start the application.
* Open browser, hit in the service URL (see below), and see the recipes at the webpage.


== Starting hints

Before downloading and starting the application, make sure your python3 environment is already installed and ready to use.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/m8nky/recipelist.git
----

And try to run it the first time.

[source,bash]
----
cd recipelist/app
./run
----

When the server is running...
